## WACAs (Theme Camps)

A Waca, at its heart, is a Theme Camp, a Schilling Point, a vibe of positive-externality where the Wamo culture emergence happens that connect and develop deeper relationships with those you are aligned with. Where Wamo’s future oriented culture springs to life, brought into being by the gathering of Wamians. It's a sanctuary for connection, where Wamians converge to engage in various activities and events. It's a realm of self-expression and communal joy, a place where creativity and collaboration come alive.

## Walues
**Positive-Externality:** We believe in the power of actions that extend beyond individual benefit, creating a ripple effect of positive impact in our community and environment. Our commitment is to cultivate a culture where every decision and action contributes to the greater good, fostering a sustainable and thriving world for all.

**Plurality:** Our strength lies in our diversity. We celebrate our differences, knowing that it is through the richness of our diverse cultures, beliefs, and backgrounds that we find our most creative and effective solutions. Plurality for us means embracing inclusivity, ensuring equal opportunities, and building a society where everyone feels seen and heard.

**Ubuntu:** "I am because we are" – this African philosophy encapsulates our belief in the interconnectedness of all. In Wamotopia, we recognize that our well-being is inextricably linked to the well-being of others. We strive to support, uplift, and empower one another, recognizing that our collective welfare paves the way for individual success.
