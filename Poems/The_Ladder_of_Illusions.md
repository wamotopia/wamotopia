# The Ladder of Illusions
Juniors, seniors in positions,

Poor and rich in capitals.

Always expected to ascend,

A narrative anchoring your reality,

Making you believe it's who you are.

You don this mask of persona,

Letting it consume you,

Its power overtaking your agency.

You forget your dreams,

Forget that you can better the world,

Aim for the stars.

Reality is but a manifestation

Of our collective dreams.
