# Veils of Perception

If we blissed in joy, we see the world as good,

No urge for change perceived in such a mood.

Sentiments skews our view, not aligning with reality,

Success may share this blissful fallacy.

One might revel in life, yet remain blind,

To the need for change, in their peace of mind.

Meanwhile, the paranoid see doom at every turn,

But relations to the world need not be so stern.

Opinions, mere reflections of our inner state,

Feelings gauge the truth, dictate fate.

We forge abstract symbols to represent our inner tides,

Values that carry emotions across reality's divides.

An intersubjective reality emerges, born from shared ideals,

Aligning over values, a common ground that feels.

We craft narratives coherent with these values, believing them real,

Thinking constructed stories reflect the world's deal.

These narratives wield power, shaping our view,

Creating a reality that we hold true.
