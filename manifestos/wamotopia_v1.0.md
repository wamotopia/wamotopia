# Wamotopia Manifesto v1.0 alpha.1

Wamotopia is a gathering at a pivotal crossroads in human history. We gather here not just to celebrate or reflect but to build a future-oriented culture, a consensus-driven approach to shaping tomorrow. Wamotopia is more than a gathering; it's a symposium of minds and hearts, a confluence of ideas and dreams, where each of us plays a crucial role in defining the trajectory of our collective journey.

## The Pivotal Juncture

We stand at a pivotal juncture in history, where the explosive growth of frontier technologies like AGI and Web3, coupled with the rise of diverse and impactful ideologies, is reshaping art, society, and the very essence of humanity. These ideologies range from the progressive visions of DAO, Plurality, Metamodernism, E/Acc and Effective Altruism, to the complex and controversial narratives seen in movements like QAnon. These varied beliefs and perspectives are not just academic theories; they are actively influencing public discourse, policy, and personal worldviews.

Technological advancements, particularly in AGI, offer a tantalizing preview of a future that is more liberated and interconnected. However, this bright horizon is shadowed by urgent, pressing challenges that demand our immediate awareness and action. Amidst this backdrop of technological singularity and ideological evolution, we face urgent, multifaceted challenges like AI alignment, unchecked molochs, faltering leviathans, societal and ecological degradation, metacrisis, and the need for effective global coordination. In this defining moment for humanity, the future history of Earth is being written, and it is in our hands.

## Our Mission

As we embark on this quest, we must tread carefully, aware of the delicate balance that holds our world together. The prospect of a dystopian future, where technology and narratives overpower humanity or leads us astray, looms as a stark reminder of the responsibility that comes with creation. Our gathering at Wamotopia is a pledge – a pledge to steer our collective future towards the light of humanity and away from the shadows of doom.

## A Call to Action

This is our call to action. It's an invitation to everyone who sees the importance of discussing, raising awareness, and envisioning the future. How do we wish to live, play, enjoy life, and create a better culture, in a future where labors are no longer needed? How can we restructure our society better, in the era of abundance? These are the questions we come together to explore.

Let’s unite under the principle of positive-externality actions, seeking answers together, dreaming together, and building together. We ponder over creating the most imaginative and inspiring culture – to find and forge a path to a future where freedom, prosperity, and peace are not just ideals, but lived experiences. We envision a world where challenges like cancer are conquered, where necessities, longevity and health are accessible to all, where society harmonizes in a symphony of diverse voices and dreams, and where we deliberate not just on whether to turn our future into utopia or dystopia, but on stride towards a world that resonates with our deepest values, freedom and prosperity.

Join us in this journey at Wamotopia, our collective canvas, where each of us holds a brush. Whether through vibrant strokes of action or delicate touches of awareness and presence, we are all painting a picture of a future that is not just hopeful but taking shape in the here and now. Together, we are more than just dreamers – we are creators of the next chapter in humanity's story. Let's make it a chapter of hope, of joy, and of boundless possibilities, by co-learning, co-creating, living well and spreading joy, we are contributing to a brighter, more beautiful world.
